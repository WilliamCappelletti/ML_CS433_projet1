# CDM Group Project

The purpose of this project is to generate an ML model able to infer the presence, or absence, of the Higgs Boson starting from CERN measurements. The data were obtained on the Kaggle competition platform (https://www.kaggle.com/c/epfml18-higgs).

In this README you will find general information about the methods, and a more detailed documentation is given within the functions.

## Getting Started

The code provided was tested with Python 3.6.5.
The following libraries are used within the script:

Computational:

    numpy (as np)

Graphical:

    seaborn (as sns)
    matplotlib (as plt)


### Prerequisites

The folder structure is the following:

    .
    ├── Data                    # Data files, in .csv
    ├── src                     # Source files
    └── README.md

All the scripts are in src, where in `run.py` you can find the code that generates our prediction.


## What we have done

### run.py

<!-- @Marie put here the description of how you obtained the best model! (general and schematic should be fine) -->

### Implementation of class methods.

For the sake of automation 

| Function           | Arguments | Info |
|--------------------|-----------|------|
| `least_squares_GD` | `y, tx, initial_w[, max_iters, gamma,]`  |
